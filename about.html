    <h1>Edward Lai</h1>
        <p>
            Hello, my name is Edward Lai. I am excited to share a bit about myself and why I decided to take this class. 
            I have always been interested about websites and designing interfaces, 
            and I believe that taking this class will allow me to enhance my skills and expand my knowledge in these areas.
        </p>
        <p>
            Over the years, I have studied a little bit of web programming on the side. 
            I have some experience in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, 
            which have allowed me to build interactive websites. 
            I have also dabbled in using languages like Python and C++. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, I am looking to enhance my skills in this area to build a portfolio website for myself and also
            use it for neat purposes next for my clubs that I do at Tufts University. I run the chess club at Tufts so I would
            like to make a neat website for information about the club.
        </p>
        <p> 
            I am eager to dive deeper into web programming and software development through this class. 
            I believe that by participating in this course, I will gain valuable knowledge, 
            improve my problem-solving abilities, and become a more proficient developer.
        </p>

        <li>Sichuan Red Chilli Chicken</li>
        <li>Pho Dac Biet</li>
        <li>Pork Belly</li>

    <h2>Favorite Restaurant - Dakzen</h2>
    <p>
        <a href="http://www.dakzen.net/">Dakzen</a> I love this restaurant because of 
        its cozy ambiance and delicious food. The staff is always friendly, 
        and they have a wide variety of dishes to choose from. It is the only Thai restaurant
        near Tufts and it is open until 2 AM on most days which means great for late dining.
        Also, the pork belly grapow rice dish is fire. 
    </p>

    <h2>Favorite Food - Sichuan Chicken</h2>
    <img src="images/sichuan_chicken.jpeg" alt="Favorite Food (Sichuan Chicken)" class="food-image">
    <p>
        Sichuan Red Chilli chicken is my all-time favorite food.<br>
        I enjoy it every time I eat it and I always get it whenever I am at a chinese restaurant.<br>
        I use chopsticks and pick up pieces like popcorn but I chew really slowly to savor it.<br>
        It has the the perfect combination of spice, salt, and crispiness that makes it so good.<br>
        I recommend it 10/10 and I would always get it at Chilli Garden in Medford.<br>
